# CHESSGAME
Simple chess game using pyglet right now the user always start with whites and the computer does not have an AI for that

## TODO 
- [ ] Add all the pieces
- [ ] How to know when piece to stop
- [ ] When a piece was remove or eat remove that piece from the board
- [ ] Make the game to have the turns
- [ ] add special cases when a piece is for example at the end of the board

## Wish list
Due that program has a lot of variables, I would like to start to define the type of the input of the parameters


## Notes

- Once choose a piece if the next move is not inside of the possible moves then
 clean the board

- Looks like the new calculate_update_square function to udpate the graphics is working properly. It will required testing with rook and queen. 

## Issues
- [ ] Sometimes to select an figure it requires to click twice
- [ ] There is a weird bug that when a pawn move appear another
    weird square selected. IDK what is going on
