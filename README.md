# CHESSGAME
Simple chess game using pyglet right now the user always start with whites and the computer does not have an AI for that

## TODO 
- [ ] Add all the pieces
- [ ] Be able to click a piece and see the possible moves
- [ ] Add oponent piece
- [ ] How to know when piece to stop


## Notes

- Once choose a piece if the next move is not inside of the possible moves then
 clean the board

- Looks like the new calculate_update_square function to udpate the graphics is working properly. It will required testing with rook and queen. 

## Issues
- [ ] Sometimes to select an figure it requires to click twice
- [ ] There is a weird bug that when a pawn move appear another
    weird square selected. IDK what is going on
